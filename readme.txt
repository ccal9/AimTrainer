This game is meant to be a test of precision for people who play FPS games. 
When started, this game will start to spawn red targets that grow in size until they disappear 2 seconds after they were spawned, 
or when they are clicked, whatever happens first. 
The idea with growing targets is that you will need to be more precise if you want to clear the target earlier. 
As the game progesses, the frequency at which the targets spawn will increase, giving the player more targets to click. 
As it is, the game will go until 40 targets have spawned, 
with a minimum time of .5s in between targets being reached a bit over halfway through
